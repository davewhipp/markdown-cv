# markdown-cv

This repository hosts my curriculum vitae maintained in plain text (Markdown) and rendered to html and pdf using CSS and GitHub Actions.

This project is a fork of [Eliseo Papa's (elipapa) markdown cv repository](http://elipapa.github.io/markdown-cv). Feel free to check the original for updates, as I forked this a while ago :).
